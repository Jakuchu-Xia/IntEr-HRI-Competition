1. Ensemble Model

- 10 Fold Validation

- Accuracy.txt
The Accuracy.txt file contains the classification accuracy for each validation cycle.

- Confusion Matrix
The Confusion Matrix contains the result of the Ensemble model. Each confusion matrix is normalized.

The Predicted label presents the predict output from the label, True label shows the actual label in validation dataset.

"S 96" shows the event for Error Induction, "S 80" presents the event for Button press, "no error" shows the event for other labels.

- F1 Score
f1_score.txt shows the result of F1 score.

2. ResNet Model

10-fold cross-validation organized by each subject. avg.txt contains the average F1 score of the 10 trials and the average confusion matrix. avg_cm.png is the average confusion matrix plot.
